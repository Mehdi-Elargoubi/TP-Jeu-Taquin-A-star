# TP-Jeu-Taquin-A-star

This project implements the A* algorithm to solve the Taquin puzzle (also known as the sliding puzzle). The goal is to find the most efficient path to arrange the puzzle pieces in numerical order.

## Project Structure

- `autre_code_Complet.py`: An alternative complete implementation of the solver.
- `code_Complet.py`: The main complete code implementing A* to solve the Taquin puzzle.
- `code_Complet_Am√©liorer.py`: An improved version of the main solver.
- `codeStructer/main.py`: The structured version of the main script to execute the solver.
- `codeStructer/Noeud.py`: The node class used to represent puzzle states in the solver.
- `codeStructer/Solveur.py`: The solver class implementing the A* algorithm.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mehdi/TP-Jeu-Taquin-A-star.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd TP-Jeu-Taquin-A-star
   ```

3. Install Python 3.6 or higher from the official website:

   [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


## Usage

Run the main script to solve a Taquin puzzle using A* algorithm:

```bash
python codeStructurer/main.py
```

You can modify the puzzle state within the code or feed it via input to test different configurations.

## Features

- A* Algorithm for solving the Taquin puzzle.
- Multiple implementations of the solver: basic, structured, and improved versions.
- Easy to modify and extend.
